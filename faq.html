<dt><strong>About Myself</strong></dt>
<dd> I am really eager to learn and I enjoy being organized. The field of computers and phones interest me because there is always room to learn. Everything is always changing. </dd>
<br>
<dt><strong>What Are My Strengths?</strong></dt>
<dd>I’d say my strengths are having a positive attitude and determination.</dd>
<br>
<dt><strong>What Are My Greatest Weaknesses?</strong></dt>
<dd>I’d say my biggest weaknesses are my fear of public speaking, harsh self-criticism, and working with a team. 
<br>
<strong><i>Public Speaking </i></strong>
<br>
<strong><i>Harsh Self-Criticism</i></strong>
<br>
For me, if I am doing something I like to try to do it 110%. If I am going to take the time out to do it, I want to do it right instead of having to redo it. However, at times this can lead me to taking a little longer because I am always looking at how to make changes to make it better. 
<br>
<strong><i>Working With a Team</i></strong>
<br>
It’s not the fact that I can’t get along with people because I like to believe that I can easily. I’d rather listen to others speak than speak myself. For me, it’s more that I don’t always trust that the other person will get the work done completely, to the best of their ability, or on time. I like to be self-sufficient.
